# GIT

# Cherry-Pick
git cherry pick enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD.

# Merge
The existing branches are not changed in any way.
Integrates changes from one branch into another, creating a merge commit. It preserves branch histories but can result in a more complex history with merge bubbles. 

# Rebase
Reapplies changes from one branch on top of another, resulting in a linear commit history. It can make the history cleaner but may require conflict resolution.
